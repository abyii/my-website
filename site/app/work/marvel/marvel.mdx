# Marvel

Marvel is a Makerspace and R&D Lab in UVCE (The 100 year old engineering college i attend). The lab started out with a bunch of programmes and there was the need for a web app to go along with the programmes. Here was a problem that can be solved with code (and design), and as you're probably guessing, my work with marvel started here.

Today the web app is used by hundreds of students to document and showcase their courseworks and project works. It has user profiles, access management over resources, a review system, custom event pages for when the lab conducts events, and a logo. I learnt a few things during this continous, and iterative process of building the product, and in this page, I've written about that journey.
