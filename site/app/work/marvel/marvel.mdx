    Marvel is a Makerspace/lab in UVCE. The lab just got started when I was in my 2nd year of college, with the goal of providing the students, the space and support to collaborate and build cool stuff. It came out with a bunch of programmes to get the students involved. And, there was the need for a webapp to make these programmes happen. My work with marvel began here.

    Today, hundreds of students use the webapp to document and showcase their course works and project works. It has user profiles, access management over resources, a review system, event pages for when the lab conducts events, and a logo.
